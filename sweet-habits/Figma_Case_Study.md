## 💖 Project Overview
Sweet Habits is a pastel, cozy mobile habit tracker that encourages users to build consistency through kindness and delight.  
The design blends **UX psychology**, **soft emotional branding**, and **gamified UI** to improve motivation.

---

## 🎯 Problem
Habit-tracking apps often feel clinical or overwhelming, leading users to abandon them quickly.  
Users expressed a desire for **positive reinforcement**, **simple visuals**, and **emotional connection**.

## 🌷 Research Summary
| Method | Description | Outcome |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **User Interviews** | 5 participants ages 18–29 | Identified motivation drop-off after 3 days |
| **Competitive Audit** | Compared 4 popular habit apps | Most lacked emotional engagement |
| **Surveys** | Asked what makes tracking enjoyable | 87% preferred “cute” and “encouraging” visuals |

🪄 **Insight:** People stay consistent when their progress feels *celebrated*, not *monitored.*
